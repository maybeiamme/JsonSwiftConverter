with received json response

## Command line usage

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `converter` JsonSwiftConverter from the command line, you'll need to install [JsonSwiftConverter](https://github.com/maybeiamme/JsonSwiftConverter) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```

This adds the `converter` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

### Run

```sh
$ converter -H HEADER -X GET -N ClassName -A public -P ./Generated.swift
```

**What will happen?**

Then jsonswiftconverter will create structs conforming codable protocols.
